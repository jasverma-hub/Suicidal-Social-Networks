Mental Health Awareness Month: I have schizoaffective bipolar type and I just graduated with my BA in English (Magna Cum Laude) at age 28 after dropping out of high school and having intermittently relapsed into psychosis for a duration of 8 hospitalizations. With loving support success is possible
Not to brag, but instead of laying in bed ALL day, I laid in bed for MOST of the day, then got up and took a shower. Next up, I conquer the world.
I DIDN'T KILL MYSELF LAST NIGHT!
It‚Äôs been 2 months to the day since I last self harmed. I just want someone to be proud of me.
I made a suicide scale. Hoping it could help others.
PREACH

To the man who saved my life and never knew
To the person who deleted their post few minutes ago.
Today is my birthday and I'm 18 days clean! I want to share my victory with you guys because I'm quite alone.
Want an emotional support animal but can't have one? Get a stuffed animal.
Today I am officially 1 month clean of self harm. I took a bath and bought cupcakes at the supermarket. I feel happy for the first time in a long time :')
I got out of bed today :)
3 weeks clean. I've painted every time I had a major craving. I'm up to 95 canvases. So an average of 4.5 a day.

My Dad shot himself today..
6 WEEKS SINCE I LAST SELF HARMED GUYS! I cooked and watched anime. Life is good :)üåà

1 YEAR TODAY WITH NO ATTEMPT SUICIDE AND A MAJOR EPISODE
Anyone else feeling very behind everyone their age. Like they're accomplishing all these things and I'm just here.
Just because you‚Äôre struggling doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre failing. Big shout out to all in the community who made it through another day. You‚Äôre all amazing. You got this.
Depression does NOT mean feeling sad. Depression is a medical term for functioning below necessary levels
People who welcome you back with open arms after ghosting them during a severe depressive episode are like gold
TODAY I AM 5 YEARS SELF HARM FREE
You are not lazy, losing interest in a loved activity could be a warning sign
I think that ‚Äú13 reasons why‚Äù is a very bad way of ‚Äúspreading awareness‚Äù
It's okay if all you did today was survive
It's awful how mental health is never a valid excuse in college
Me irl
After 9 years of homelessness I have a roof over my head and feel good.
Women, you are not rehabilitation centers for badly raised men.
My boyfriend undressed me without asking. It‚Äôs not what you think though.
Is it just me or did everyone's mental health has gotten severely worse since the quarantine?
Stop saying "How would your parents feel" to the suicidal
I ate today!
1 week free from selfharm!
27 days cut free and I trusted myself long enough to shave my legs. I am smoooooooooth. And no nicks!
I made it 24 hours without cutting myself or drinking
I hate that no matter how hard you work to get your mental health under control, mental illness doesn‚Äôt just go away. It‚Äôs a constant struggle.
Anyone else get these short waves of getting all pumped up to do more stuff in life? But then 10 min later remember that basically life is pointless.
I'm no longer suicidal !
don‚Äôt you just love how mental disorders are basically buy one get seven free
I did it.

Read this, you need to hear it whoever you are. This is a sign.
‚ÄúDepression is being colourblind and constantly told how colourful the world is.‚Äù - Atticus

People who say things like "they should've asked for help" when somebody commits suicide are ignorant
My cat saved my life today

Celebrating 6 months since I stopped cutting ü•≥
Does anyone else get angry about how much effort you have to put in to stay stable?
3 months ago my best friend was diagnosed with clinical depression because so many bad things were happening in the world. I didn't have silghtest Idea about it. So I created an app for him.
Personal hygiene is exhausting with depression. Who can relate?
i finally showered and brushed my teeth after a depressive episode
Do you ever feel like the more you learn the more depressing the world is?
I self harmed since i was about 9.i haven't done it in 2 years now and don't have the urge to. Yay
This is what suicidal looks like
Does anyone else feels like their mental illness make them stupid/forgetful?
If you text ‚ÄúHome‚Äù to 741741 when feeling sad, anxious, or are in emotional crisis, a crisis worker will text you back immediately and continue to text with you.
Hey... so... is anyone else too afraid to leave the house because they don‚Äôt want to be seen by other humans and they just want to be invisible?
A friend sent me this poem yesterday, I didn't realize how badly I needed to hear this.
i‚Äôve been clean from self harm for one year!!
I've gone a whole calendar month without any suicidal thoughts
I just want someone to be proud of me
I DIDNT HAVE A PANIC ATTACK TODAY!!
It really annoys me when people mock your mental illness in private. Then pretend to be an advocate in public.
As of today I have been officially clean from self harm for a whole year.
A comic for people worried about starting medication
Dont forget to take your meds
It's been 100 days since I last self-harmed.
I hate when people say, ‚Äúwell things could be worse‚Äù because if you‚Äôre not coping with your current circumstances that‚Äôs an irrelevant point that really just makes you feel weak for not handling the present circumstances.
Does anyone else feel inadequate when compared to others who are their same age?
The brain is a physical organ too. Judging a person having mental health issues is like saying, "It's just a heart/kidney problem. Get over it".
‚ÄúMental illness is like fighting a war where the enemy‚Äôs strategy is to convince you that the war isn‚Äôt happening.‚Äù
I've noticed the people who say "don't have a negative mindset and you'll be happy" have been very quiet lately.
After 4 years, 7 months and now 3 days, I am anorexic free!
I showered every day this week
2 years with no attempting suicide
Is anyone else deeply depressed and barely hanging on?
When you hear "RESPECT YOUR ELDERS" its just an excuse that the older generation uses to avoid being held accountable for their abusive behaviors and/or beliefs.
I ate the everything in my plate for the first time in a week.
RIP Chadwick Boseman
Read this, please
Things that I didn't realize were anxiety
Good job
100 days self harm free today!
Do you ever sometimes think you‚Äôre not mentally ill? And then when you are back to a low spot you think ‚Äúnope. Definitely mentally ill.‚Äù Lol
Depression isn‚Äôt an aesthetic
So my therapist messaged me on Grinder ü§™
Today Marks 1 year since I've cut!! IM PROUD OF ME
Does anyone else stay up at night just because they don't want to 'wake up' the next day?
Saw a scar on my Arm from a serious suicide side attempt years ago and counted some "firsts" I would have missed out on, made me smile.
After years of BPD and a suicide attempt today I cried tears of joy because I realized I've started genuinely enjoying my life
Aspergers Syndrome in a nutshell:
I‚Äôm an agoraphobe who has hardly left the house in 3 years. This week, I‚Äôm going to the movies BY MYSELF! This will be a huge accomplishment if I can do it! Anyone else been there? Tips?
We need mental health education to become a staple in our societies
I asked for help instead of cutting myself
There should be a psychiatrist instead of a school councillors to talk to students about their mental health.
hey you
I just sat down and smiled genuinely just out of nowhere. Only a few years ago I was contemplating suicide, I am proud of this change I've made for myself. But if your ever feeling down my inbox is always open.
My life
I got dressed and brushed my hair today!
I made my therapist cry today
Well, this is appropriate here.
I wish family members would STOP saying "Everyone has anxiety, you need to learn to control it." They know I have two anxiety disorders. I tell them countless times to stop. This is why I am MOVING SEVERAL PROVINCES AWAY. They do not respect my boundaries. I can't wait until I move in December.
My psychologist told me to kill myself
Bernie Sanders is the only Democrat fighting for universal mental health care
You won reddit
I have a million reasons to die, but I have ONE reason to live. ONE friend who cares about me. AND I'M GOING TO FUCKING LIVE FOR HIM
YAY
I didn‚Äôt realize how long I‚Äôd gone without laughing until something made me genuinely laugh
I'm proud of all of you for being here today. For choosing life.
I haven't self harmed since 2 years
I Am Thoroughly Disgusted By The Portrayal of Mental Health in 13 Reasons Why Season 4, And Disturbed By the Amount of People Defending It.
Its not much but after 15 years of self harming, it has been one year to the day since I last had an incident. Longest Ive ever gone.
Is anyone else depressed about working for the rest of our lives
You're not everyone's cup of tea
7 hours ago I found out that the girl I've been trying to get over for the past year and half killed herself more than 10 months ago and I'm shattered.
Broke down during my night shift in the ER tonight
I (m22) got yelled for openly crying on the beach.
I‚Äôm proud that you‚Äôre alive today
Whatever happens, don't let "theepicking777" bully you into misery
Did anyone else always get called mature when they were young, and then develop anxiety or add or depression or ocd?
The thought of working 40+ hours for the rest of my life makes me want to end it
This checklist has helped me through some tough times, so I thought I'd pass it on.
Heyyy you
Me with work.
Suicide hotlines are useless for people struggling with mental illness
Does anybody else with depression struggle with bad emotional lows right after a really good event with someone you really care about comes to an end?

I GOT 9 HOURS OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT
I love you
2 nights ago I lost my best friend, my father, to his mental health issues. I just pray he is finally at peace. Please always reach out to your loved ones who struggle with depression and remind them that they are never alone. Love you forever daddy.
Emotion Color Wheel. My therapist gave me this as a visual aid; it helps me to figure out what I'm feeling in the midst of panic attacks. I hope it helps you as well.
After several years of therapy I no longer hate myself. I now hate everyone else though ü§®
I told my whole family I was raped by my dad my whole life...
Just because some people don't make a scene of their mental disorders, doesn't mean they aren't struggling
Does anyone else have this running "I hate myself" voice in their head that spontaneously replays over and over?
People who are battling mental ilness on their own because mental health is still taboo in your country or because you don't have the money to afford treatment, raise your hand!‚úã
I made a big breakfast after months of not washing, barely eating, just not taking care of myself. It‚Äôs been ages. I‚Äôm proud. :D
I learned an important lesson from my therapist about healing.
I [14F] Survived A School Shooting and Now I Feel Numb
Would someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today.
You don't need to have a crazy story to be valid
150 Days today without self harming!
Does anyone else get a high from being with friends or family, and then afterwards crash into depression?
You can sound confident & have anxiety. You can look healthy but feel like shit. You can look happy & be miserable inside. You can be good looking & feel ugly. So be kind, because every person is fighting a battle you know nothing about
Today I was at the pool with my apparent scars for the first time in my life and I am incredibly proud of myself :') ‚ô°
Does anyone grieve the potential they had but lost to mental illness?
I recently read this and I think it might help someone else too: ‚ÄúAlways do your best‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúwork until you collapse‚Äù. If you push yourself past your best abilities you will do worse. Doing your best means knowing your limits and working within them.
I don't want quarantine to end
61 days self harm free, and fifteen days off lexapro. It does get better people :)
My reason for getting out of bed every morning...
Does anyone else feel like they're simply existing & not living?
I ate in a restaurant by myself!
21 yr old M here just to say that yes boys can have eating disorders too

I'm so happy I didn't commit suicide last May.
Shoutout to anyone who is spending Easter alone due to their mental issues. You‚Äôre not alone.

I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I just want to tell SOMEONE
Stop blaming your shit parenting on my phone.
I just got my first paycheck at my first job ever.
I brushed, flossed, used mouthwash, got lunch with my mom AND played video games!
I finally took a shower and brushed my teeth !
I regret having a baby :(
Threatening suicide as a means of control: It is toxic. Don't do it.

COVID-19 Is a bitch. If anyone during this time is having a hard time coping, anxious, suicidal, just bored or depressed. Please vent to me and I will do my best to help you and your feelings/thoughts!
I asked Dan Harmon for advice on dealing with depression, and he was kind enough to deliver
I just want to go home sometimes
Anyone else‚Äôs anxiety going crazy with all that‚Äôs going on in the world?
I hate when people say suicide is selfish
Does anyone else with depression (or really any illness or just in general) not even have the motivation to watch shows?

I just had my very first business related phone call today (for graphic design) and I‚Äôm so proud of myself! Talking on the phone is always hard for me and I did it!! üòåüòåüòåüòåüòå
I know Im a stranger but if anyone out there is feeling alone, depressed, scared, etc. And just needs a human to connect with, youre welcome to message me. We‚Äôre all in this together.
I did it! I asked a question in class!!!
Mental health problems are not beautiful or trendy and I am so done with the media glamorizing it.
watched the joker last night
Does anyone else hate the "If I can do it, you can do it" mentality
There is no feeling worse than being too scared to live but too scared to die.
I finally have a friend.
I wish there were mental illness recovery homes where individuals with the same diagnosis can live and recover together.
Pretty Ugly
Deleted all social media last night & feeling like a huge weight has been lifted off of me
My suicidal thoughts and depression.
Sometimes I just want to drive off of the road and wreck my car so people will come to my bedside and tell me they're happy im alive.
F*** COVID-19! [NSFW Language]
If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I‚Äôve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago.
Repeat After Me
I did it
I showered today.
I just had sex for the first time since I was raped
Mental health resources are a whole lot of bullshit. Deciding to reach out for help is supposed to be the hard part. Not getting it.
Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson shares about dealing with depression: "Make sure you're talking to good people about it. No shame in getting help and wanting to be better."
Watching all your friends moving on and doing stuff with there life while you're frozen in time and have no motivation to do anything at all>>>>>
Tired of playing scenarios in my head that don‚Äôt even exist.
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs is your everyday?‚Äù
I got connected to the same suicide hotline operator twice
To those whose mothers' love wasn't unconditional
Sometimes we need to laugh at our struggles. I hope you all are feeling well today.
I hate how people are expected to wait weeks, possibly MONTHS for mental health appointments.
Anyone else hate telling anyone how you feel because you feel like a burden
I called a suicide hotline recently and was dismissed because I‚Äôm a man and I have Tourette‚Äôs. üí¶ü¶Ñüòñ
I got an apology from my old psychiatrist
The life you are living is for you. Do it for yourself. It isn‚Äôt for anybody else. Live for you, honour you & love you. Never lose eye on that
Why isn‚Äôt there a such thing as an urgent care designed specifically for mental health emergencies?
Does anyone else get heavy criticism while have anxiety attacks? "You're overreacting" "fine, just have it your way then if you're going to make it such a problem" " you're ruining this by blowing it out of proportion" "you're not thinking right, so I'll make decisions for you" or is it just me?
I went to a protest and rocked this sign!
2nd day without self harm
Virtual hugs to all of you :)
Whoever comes across this, you're doing fine. Just remember that there's a whole community of people who understand and we're here.
You Are A Total Badass
My mental health is the equivalent of a dodgy knee. I'm not going to win any marathons but that doesn't mean i can't do one (and finish it in my own time)
Maybe the last time I hugged my son.
First post. I‚Äôve struggled with depression for over 12 years and I rarely put actual emotion, and pain into my art. Last week I completed my first attempt at expressing how I feel waking up lately, struggling with my depression and suicidal thoughts. Here it is: ‚ÄúThe Hand I Was Dealt‚Äù
In love with this, thought it might validate a few others as well! Artist is Megan Fabbri, she's very talented and fun
For the first time in my life, I talked with a professional about this and was told that I was downright abused and it's like a weight has been lifted off - It wasn't my fault. I wasn't a troubled kid.
I finally got the balls to sign myself up for a therapist!
I don't wanna die, just don't want to keep living.
It's okay to be a male with mental health problems.
To all those suffering today: Have a safe and calm Xmas.
Depression and anxiety dominate my life but fuel my creativity
Self harm free for 10 years!
Last month I attempted suicide for the 4th time. Today I was promoted a week into my new job. It does get better.
Isn‚Äôt this the truth!
True
Recently accepted i'm a Transgender Woman, celebrating and being good to myself today by doing my makeup and treating myself to a nice ladies night in by myself
The popular saying to ‚Äúfollow your heart/instincts/inner voice‚Äù is only helpful for those who have a proven track record of a healthy internal thought process. At 35 I‚Äôm learning that for me this is bad advice and I found that helpful to me to understand i interpret the world differently than most.
My friend died by suicide. Please listen to her wisdom & help me honor her.
Is it rude to tell people my dad died by suicide?
Even if it doesn't go away, you can get better at dealing with it
This is a battle I‚Äôm going to fight until the end. If I die, I‚Äôm going to die on my feet. My memory and appetite might be quickly declining, (as evidenced by neuropsychological tests). But I‚Äôm not going to die quietly.
Does anyone else feel like they just don't have an identity since you spend so much time coping with your illness?
Today I Got Up
Self Care
We had a protest in NYC called "I'M MENTALLY ILL, AND I DON'T KILL."
Guilting people out of suicide by telling us to think of our families isn‚Äôt the answer!
How do I stop creating fake scenarios in my head that upset me?
Does anyone feel dramatic/like a giant burden after they start talking about their emotions?
I wanna go home, but I‚Äôm already home.
My depression is not an "aesthetic". It's not cute to be a "sad boy/sad girl".
Do you ever feel like you're just so, so starved for human connection
Thinking about starting a subbreddit and or a Facebook group called "MENtality". A place where men can freely talk about their problems, to reach out to each other and help each other.
Everyone who's feeling down today, FEEL HUGGED. Let's wallow in our pain together (ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•)„Å§‚äÇ(ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•)
Does anyone else feel like they sound overly dramatic/crazy when they open up and try to verbalize their feelings? Everyday thoughts that don't feel like a big deal, but sound like they are?
Does anyone else get uncomfortable when people do nice things for you because you hate yourself?
Everytime I talk to a mental health provider about anything
This is a shout out to everyone having a down day. Keep going! Tomorrow might well be better and allow yourself to let the good times outweigh the bad, it may not seem like it now but the good days are worth putting up with the bad ones! Stay strong, you are loved!
Can we please let men open up without derailing?
Does anyone else just want to sleep to escape reality
High schools need therapists and real resources for suicidal students, not just non-suicide contracts
I'm proud of myself
It's okay to stay alive and stay healthy for the little things
My anorexia recovery
Dear mentally stable people: I‚Äôm not lazy!
Just want to give a shoutout to the person I love, who finally today, after 32 years, admitted that he needs to go to therapy
You don't need to "make the most" of this global pandemic
I stop replying to people for no reason
Do yoy guys feel like you don't deserve to be with your boyfriend/girlfriend because you feel like a messed up person and don't deserve happiness?
My boyfriend just killed himself
I tried so hard to love this country, but after all of the racism and indifference I‚Äôve faced, I‚Äôm happy I can finally leave.
STOP. ROMANTICISING.MENTAL.ILLNESS
Why are mental hospitals so fucked up and why aren't we allowed to talk about it?
you ever push everyone you used to cherish out of your life because you overthink what that thing they said means when it really doesn't mean that and your anxiety creates false narratives of situations resulting in self destruction?
You made it.
Does anybody ever feel numb for a long time and one day you get a slight rush of happiness and it makes you very emotional?
Does anyone feel like you want to hide and be alone for a few days after social interactions?
I nearly killed myself today but I‚Äôm still here
I Made FREE Mental Health Printables! (Planners, Self-Care Tips, etc.)
"That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt believe in killing yourself, because when you‚Äôre killing yourself, you‚Äôre killing a self you ain‚Äôt met yet. You‚Äôre killing yourself over your past, but what you killing is not your past‚Äîit‚Äôs already happened; you‚Äôre killing your future. 24 hours can turn your entire life around."
My first psychiatric appointment is today. Wish me luck!
Treating someone terribly and telling them to go to therapy is kinda like punching someone in the face and telling them to see a doctor
one year clean from self-harming
If anyone needs to vent or need advice with mental health. I will be here to listen to you (no matter what age) and help you as best as I can to make your day a lot better today. I love and support you‚ù£Ô∏èüå∏‚òÄÔ∏è
Anybody else spend all day counting the hours until they can go back to sleep?
my friend just called me gross for struggling with hygiene
I think mental health is a great subreddit because people come to places like these with humility and honesty. This is one place we are all the same.
I don't know who needs to hear this..
‚ÄúMaybe I should suicide myself?‚Äù
40 days hurt free. My urges are still strong, but I'm doing ok.
A year ago I left my abusive relationship... A week ago I left my abusive job!
Online school is horrible
You are still here. You are the strongest version of yourself.
PSA: It's OK to struggle with something that is hard, even when everyone else is in the same boat.
Does any one else get suspicious when life is going well and you‚Äôre happy?
I want to hug everyone that's hurting right now and tell them that we all will make it through.
Just wanted to tell someone
People LOVE to love mental illnesses when it‚Äôs the broken sadness hopeless depression type but won‚Äôt hesitate to send us to jail or get us assassinated for a single slip of the angry uncontrollable emotions type
Today I realised that the negative voices and the constant doubts going round in my head, the bad feelings ect ect aren't me, they're an illness invading my mental space.
I‚Äôm almost 24 and feel like I‚Äôve wasted my life overthinking, being anxious or depressed, having no direction in life, wanting to cut or commit suicide, being emotionally isolated from family, having no social life, feeling angry all the time, wasting money on a useless degree‚Ä¶
About 6 years ago I accidentally saw child porn on instagram and to this day I can't get the images out of my head. I feel too embarrassed to bring this up to my therapist and idk what to do.
Just cause ur black dont mean u cant have mental illness
If you were abused or felt unloved, unwanted, unheard or hated yourself as a child, please read this.
sitting on my bed with my blanket over my head and body while playing animal crossing has become my new way of coping
Changing the way you speak helps to change your perspective.
My depression is lifting. I haven't felt this happy in 3 years.
Does anyone else overly explain themselves about almost anything and or say sorry WAY TOO MUCH?
Is anyone else struggling to hang on right now?
cleaned my room for the first time in years
Who can relate?
My dad told me I‚Äôm getting ‚Äòfatter‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt finished eating. Weighed myself (no weight movement). Went to the toilet and forced vomit. I just don‚Äôt want to eat anymore. They know I‚Äôm bulimic for almost a decade. Work from home is affecting my mental health and hearing those words made it worse.
Give yourself the same love and affection you give to other people and watch yourself blossom to something special
I'm struggling with something and I'm not even sure what to call it, so please help
I wish that therapy wasn‚Äôt so outrageously expensive in the US.
Life gets a whole lot better when you stop waiting for other people to love you and start loving yourself
can a kid have mental health issues?
I feel bad that many posts in this group don't get many replies. lets try reply to two other posts for every post we put!
Someone here in Reddit messaged me to kill myself because of my previous post in another mental illness subreddit
Today you have done enough by being
Have anxiety -> go on meds -> no more anxiety -> go off meds -> have anxiety
Going from extremely horny to feeling numb to being sad to feeling nervous and anxious to being on the verge of crying and having a mental breakdown to feeling sad and being unmotivated to feeling extremely angry is completely exhausting
A toddler said hi to me today and it made me feel human.
Was anyone else called a spoiled brat growing up (or anything close to that) but now realize it was a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues?
i went to school on time today
Threw out a self harm tool.
Why does my (20m) mind immediately default to suicide when something bad happens to me?
I actually took care of myself today
Animals know
How many people are we going to lose to suicide due to this quarantine?
I have been really happy lately
I feel like a burden to my friends when I ask them to talk about my mental health
I finally told my mom
Anyone here indifferent to being alive but not suicidal?
Parents kept my mental illness a secret from me for 3 years. I had early onset childhood Schizophrenia at age 12. How do you think parents should go about breaking the news to a young child?
To everyone struggling to go to school or work this morning,
I'm clean from self harm :)
5 days blade free. I forced myself to use colours. Hopefully it will brighten your day, somewhat.
Good kid
The cost for inpatient mental health treatment is fucking shameful.
I finally shaved!!!
Mental illnesses do not affect us in equal ways, but they all suck.
Working in an ICU showed me the other side of suicide
Andy Richter‚Äôs response to ‚ÄúDepression is a choice.‚Äù Nailed it.
1 year clean!!
I put blankets over my head when I'm sad and pretend I'm a turtle.
I think I was/am an unintentionally toxic person and its torturing me
I hate it here
I know it's weird to celebrate but yesterday was the most "normal" day I've had in 3 years
You‚Äôre not a fucking manic pixie dream girl, and mania is not cute
Just about sums it up
Does anyone else feel guilty for their struggles with mental health?
Mental health has no direct ‚Äúcure‚Äù and a lot of the times I think we have to figure it out on our own. Society doesn‚Äôt necessarily understand our struggle and we have to try and show them why mental health care is important.
I built a free mental health app after being stuck in my tiny studio in NYC
is anyone super obsessed with how they walk?
Let's love ourselves as well as each other. (x-post blackpeopletwitter)
Anyone slowly realize they were very talented at something just to have mental illness destroy everything?
This mirror constantly made me feel like shit. Olanzapine and effexor has ruined my skin and I've put on a decent amount of weight. I hate what was looking back at me. So I did the only thing I can do well. Painted the mirror. I hate it less now.
