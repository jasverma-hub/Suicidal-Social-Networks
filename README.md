# Content Analysis of Messages in Social Networks, Identification of Suicidal Types

# Introduction

The "Content Analysis of Messages in Social Networks, Identification of Suicidal Types" is a Python Django project aimed at addressing mental health concerns in social media platforms. The project focuses on analyzing the content of messages shared on social networks to identify potential signs of suicidal tendencies or mental distress. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the application aims to classify and flag messages that may indicate suicidal thoughts, enabling timely intervention and support for individuals in distress.

# Key Features

1. Data Collection and Integration:
The project involves collecting messages and posts from various social media platforms using APIs or web scraping techniques. The collected data is then integrated into the Django web application for analysis.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
The application utilizes NLP libraries and algorithms to preprocess and analyze the textual content of messages. NLP helps in identifying patterns, keywords, and sentiment that may indicate suicidal tendencies.

3. Sentiment Analysis:
The project performs sentiment analysis to determine the emotional tone of messages. Negative sentiment, combined with specific keywords, can serve as indicators of potential distress.

4. Classification Models:
Machine learning models are trained on labeled datasets to classify messages into different categories, such as "No Suicidal Tendencies," "Low Risk," "Moderate Risk," and "High Risk." These categories help prioritize the urgency of intervention.

5. Real-time Monitoring and Alerts:
The application continuously monitors incoming messages and identifies those that show signs of potential risk. Real-time alerts are generated for high-risk messages, enabling immediate intervention and assistance.

6. User Authentication and Privacy:
The project includes user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized professionals or mental health experts can access the identified messages. This ensures privacy and confidentiality for the users.

7. User Interface and Visualization:
The Django web application provides a user-friendly interface for mental health professionals to review flagged messages. The dashboard displays visualizations and statistics to assist in understanding trends and patterns related to suicidal tendencies.

8. Multi-platform Support:
The application is designed to be compatible with multiple social media platforms, making it versatile in reaching a broader audience and helping individuals across various networks.
