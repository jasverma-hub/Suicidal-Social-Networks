Suicide ideation expressed in social media has an impact on language usage. Many at-risk individuals use social
forum platforms to discuss their problems or get access to information on similar tasks. The key objective of
our study is to present ongoing work on automatic recognition of suicidal posts. We address the early detection

Reddit social media.
